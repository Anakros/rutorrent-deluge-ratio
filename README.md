# rutorrent-deluge-ratio
ruTorrent plugin to show Deluge Ratio

This is a plug that will add 2 columns to ruTorrent.  The DlgRatio and the TotalRatio.

This is used for transfering data from deluge into rtorrent, but don't want to lose the stats.

This plugin was originally copied from the seedingtime plugin, then modified.  I don't know much about JS or PHP, so this is what I came up with.
